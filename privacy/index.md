**What personal information do I collect from visitors?**

Through Google Analytics, I get aggregate data about my website's traffic and user interaction. To minimize the amount of personal data gathered by Google Analytics, I have disabled [Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611268).

If you do not wish to be tracked by my website via Google Analytics, this website honors the 'Do Not Track' setting of your browser (if available). You can also download the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**When does this website collect information?**

Google Analytics collects information from you when you visit this website.

**How do I use your information?**

I use the information (provided by Google Analytics) to get aggregate data about website traffic and website interaction.

**How do I protect visitor information?**

This website does not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.

This website does not use Malware Scanning.

This website does not use an SSL certificate; I only provide articles and information. I never ask for personal or private information like email addresses, or credit card numbers.

**Does this website use 'cookies'?**

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. While this website does not use cookies directly, Google Analytics uses them to help compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction.

**I use cookies to:**

- Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions. I use Google Analytics as a third-party service that tracks this information on my behalf.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser  settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

If you disable cookies, it won't affect your experience in any way.

**Third-party disclosure**

I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

**Third-party links**

Occasionally, at my discretion, I may include or offer third-party products or services on this website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. I therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, I seek to protect the integrity of this website and welcome any feedback about these sites.

**COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.  The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

I do not specifically market to children under 13.
