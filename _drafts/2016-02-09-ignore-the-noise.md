Whether you're new to the JavaScript ecosystem or have some experience, unless you're Superman, you'll inevitably become overwhelmed at the sheer number of frameworks, libraries, build systems, pre-compilers, templating engines (the list goes on) to invest in. What's worse, as soon as you put a significant amount of time into a set of them, there will inevitably be others that gain more popularity than your choices, or even new ones that became the shiny new thing while you were working.

As a personal anecdote, a couple years ago I invested quite a bit of time in Backbone.Marionette, and once I had some breathing room and took a step back, I saw that Angular was the cool kid on the block. I also used LESS and Handlebars (for CSS preprocessing and HTML templating, respectively), although tons of shops prefer SASS and there are many other popular alternatives to Handlebars. It's easy to feel like you're not keeping up, and that your skills will soon become irrelevant if you're not sprinting at full-speed 24 hours a day. So I'll go ahead and say it: no matter what you do, at least when it comes to web development, you're going to be behind in one way or another.

All this to say: it doesn't matter. Just **ignore the noise**.
