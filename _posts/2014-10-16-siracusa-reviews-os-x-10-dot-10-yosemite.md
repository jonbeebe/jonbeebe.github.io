For some, John Siracusa's OS X reviews are almost as anticipated as the OS release itself. Myself included.

His conclusion sums up all twenty-five pages well:

> The Mac today is just one part of a conceptually, organizationally, and (increasingly) technologically unified platform that spans from wrist to workstation. The hardware-based platforms of the past remain relevant to developers, but Apple seems determined to make them much less important to its customers. With Yosemite, the Mac has taken its first step into a larger world.
