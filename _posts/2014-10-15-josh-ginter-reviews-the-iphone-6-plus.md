Posted yesterday on the newly redesigned [Tools and Toys][toolsandtoys] website:

> Appleâ€™s newest iPhones are a story of tradeoffs for the first time in their history. Gone are the days of true corner-to-corner one handed use. Say goodbye to not noticing your iPhone in your front pocket, or even carrying your iPhone in your front pocket.

I just received my iPhone 6 Plus yesterday (finally!), so my review will be posted once I've had enough time with it.
