Depending on who you are, "working from home" either sounds like a dream situation, or a nightmare. I was in the former camp and in 2009, working full-time from home became a reality for me. It wasn't all sunshine and roses though. Getting to a consistently productive state was more difficult than I had anticipated.

I wont argue that working from home is better than working from an office. I personally don't believe there is a "better" among the two. It totally depends on the person, the company, as well as the type of work and possibly other factors. For me, home is the by far the better option. For you, that may not be the case. Although I'd wager that if you've read this far, you're probably at least interested in the idea.

## Mindset

The first big challenge I faced was getting used to the mindset shift. I expected not much to change, but everything to just get better. The truth is, the act of "going to work" trains us to shift into that mindset automatically. At home, that shift doesn't always occur and you find that it's difficult to get focused initially.
