My favorite task management app for Mac (and iOS) just got updated to support OS X 10.10 Yosemite. The visual changes mirror that of Yosemite's: refreshing but still familiar.

I haven't got used to using Notification Center Widgets regularly yet, but the new "Today" widget in Things may be just what I need to get started.
